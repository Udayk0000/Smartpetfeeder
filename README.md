# smartpetfeeder

Welcome to the Smart Pet Feeder GitHub Repository! This project combines the power of IoT with the seamless integration of ESP32 and Arduino Uno R3. The ESP32 is harnessed through the Blynk library, enabling a robust connection between the device and the Blynk cloud. The Arduino, serving as the brains behind the operation, utilizes 2-wire communication to measure distance, relaying this data to the ESP32. A LCD screen, connected via I2C communication protocol, provides real-time feedback on the ESP32's WiFi and Blynk cloud connectivity. When the Arduino detects a specified distance, it promptly alerts the ESP32, triggering a notification on the Blynk app. Users can take control through the app, initiating food dispersal via a servo motor with a simple command. This project seamlessly combines hardware and software to create a user-friendly, automated pet feeding solution. Explore the code, schematics, and documentation to build your own Smart Pet Feeder and keep your furry friends happy and well-fed!
